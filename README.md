# MovieApi

This is an ASP.NET Core Web API project is third weekly assignment of Experis Academy. Assignment was made as a group project with Mikko Nikku and Sebastian SÃ¶derholm. It is an application constructed in ASP.NET Core. It includes a RESTful API to interact with an SQL Server database built with Entity Framework. The RESTful API can be used to create, read, update and delete data from the database. 

The API consists of three objects:
- Movies - A movie can have multiple characters and one franchise.
- Characters - A character can be a part of multiple movies
- Franchises - A franchise can have multiple movies

The database can be duplicated through the add-migration, following the Model Creation rules of the `MovieDbContext.cs` file.
