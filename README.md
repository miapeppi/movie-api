# MovieApi

This is a ASP.NET Core Web API project made for learning purposes. It is an application constructed in ASP.NET Core. It includes a RESTful API to interact with an SQL Server database built with Entity Framework.

The RESTful API can be used to create, read, update and delete data from the database. 

The database can be duplicated through the add-migration, following the Model Creation rules of the `MovieDbContext.cs` file.
